This is my very first HTML and CSS project. I created it as a way to practice what I’ve been learning — from basic structure and styling to a little bit of creativity with layouts and effects.

The page is designed around the theme of God of War, one of my favorite games. It includes a login form, character information, and a skills list for Kratos. I used a dark background and red highlights to match the game’s powerful and intense atmosphere.

Some of the things I learned while building this project:

How to structure a webpage with HTML (using headings, paragraphs, forms, and lists).

How to style elements using CSS — like setting background images, adding hover effects, shadows, borders, and transitions.

How to position elements (like placing the login form on the right side).

And most importantly, how design and code can come together to create something that feels alive.

It’s not perfect, but it means a lot to me because it’s the first step in my web development journey. Every part of this page — the colors, layout, and small animations — helped me understand how web design actually works in practice.
